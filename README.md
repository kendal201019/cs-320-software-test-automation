How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  To ensure that my code is functional and secure, I will create tests to ensure that the program is performing as intended, without any issues.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?  
  To incorporate user needs into my programs we first have to develop a document where we agree to all the specifications of the program, as well as how those specifications will be met. Once completed, we will build the program with all the necessary tests to ensure that it performs as expected. 

How do I approach designing software?
  My approach to designing software has changed by taking this class. Now to future projects, I will put more effort to ensure that the specifications documents are written properly to ensure that we have a clear understanding of what must be created. It has also changed in the sense, that now I put more importance to testing, to ensure that the programs I write work in the way it is intended with no issues.
